# MedicineBuddy - Medicine Reminder System

This project is a system developed to ensure that people take their medications on time. The application supports three types of users: patients, buddies, and doctors.

## Features

- **Patients**: Patients are paired with a buddy to ensure they take their medications on time. If a patient misses their medication, a notification is sent to their buddy.
- **Buddies**: Buddies can add multiple patients to their care list. They receive alerts when any of their patients miss a medication dose, allowing them to follow up and ensure the patient takes their medication.
- **Doctors**: Doctors can monitor multiple patients, reviewing their medication adherence history. They can track whether patients are consistently taking their prescribed medications.

## Technologies Used

- **Mobile Application**: Developed using Flutter, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across both Android and iOS devices.
- **Backend**: Built with Spring Boot, providing a robust and scalable server-side application.
- **Database**: MySQL is used for reliable and efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**: Firebase is utilized for handling real-time notifications and authentication.
